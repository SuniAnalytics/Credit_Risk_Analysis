# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

  Objective of the project is to utilize machine learning to solve credit card loan risk assessment. 
  As part of the project, we need to evaluate all the factors from the data set that can help predict a loan with low/high risk category. 
  
  This reqiures utilizing machine learning, statistical analysis and evaluation of multiple models. 
  
  Followed below steps to identify best possible model to use to predict credit risk among the 6 ML models:
  - Read the data, data cleanup
  - Split data to train and test data
  - Oversampling models (Naive Random, SMOTE)
  - Undersampling model (Cluster Centroids)
  - Combination sampling (SMOTEEN)
  - Ensemble Models to minimize bias (Balanced Randon Forest Classifier, Easy ensemble AdaBoost classifier)
